# Get Started with Bing Speech API in cURL

Exercise Bing Speech Recognition API using cURL to convert spoken audio to text by sending audio to Microsoftâ€™s servers in the cloud. The example below is **bash** commands that demonstrates the use of Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) Speech To Text API using **cURL**.

The Speech Recognition web example demonstrates the following features using a wav file or external microphone input:
 * Access token generation
 * Short-form recognition
This example assumes that **cURL** is available in your bash environment.

### <a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>
* #### Platform requirements
The below example has been developed in **bash**. (Also works in git bash/zsh/etc)

* #### Subscribe to Speech API and get a free trial subscription key
Before creating the example, you must subscribe to Speech API which is part of Microsoft Cognitive Services (previously Project Oxford). For subscription and key management details, see [Subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up). Both the primary and secondary key can be used in this tutorial.

### <a name="Step1">Step 1: Generate an access token</a>
1.	Replace **your_subscription_key** with your own subscription key and run the command in **bash**.

    `curl -v -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken" -H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=your_subscription_key&client_secret=your_subscription_key&scope=https://speech.platform.bing.com'`

2.	Save the the string value of **access_token** in the resonse.
    `{"access_token":"**save_this_token**","token_type":"jwt","expires_in":"600","scope":"https://speech.platform.bing.com"}`


### <a name="Step2">Step 2: Upload the audio binary</a>
1.	Replace **your_instance_id**, **your_request_id**, **your_locale**, **your_device_os** in accordance to your own application; Replace **your_access_token** with the token retrieved from [Step 1](#Step1); Replace **your_wave_file** with the actual wave file and run the command in **bash**.

    `curl -v -X POST "https://speech.platform.bing.com/recognize?scenarios=smd&appid=D4D52672-91D7-4C74-8AD8-42B1D98141A5&locale=your_locale&device.os=your_device_os&version=3.0&format=json&instanceid=your_instance_id&requestid=your_request_id" -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token' -H 'Content-type: audio/wav; codec="audio/pcm"; samplerate=16000' --data-binary @your_wave_file`

2. Parse the Succcessful recognition response or Error response
